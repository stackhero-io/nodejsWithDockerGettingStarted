# Getting Started with Node.js and Docker

Here is a boilerplate to use Node.js with Docker, in development and production in minutes.

You'll find all the informations about it in the [documentation](https://www.stackhero.io/en/services/Docker/documentations/Node-js).

This boilerplate can be used in production with any Docker hosting service.

However, some solutions can be complex and confusing to use. That's why Stackhero created a Docker containers cloud hosting platform with easy-to-use features such as:
- 💪 Easy to set up and run with minimal effort
- 🐳 Uses Docker for development and production environments
- 🔄 Automatically reloads Node.js upon code changes (using nodemon)
- 🚀 Deploys to production with a single command
- 🔒 Handles TLS certificates for secure HTTPS encryption
- 🚧 Supports staging/preprod platforms
- 🧱 Highly modular and scalable

> 💡 If you're new to Stackhero, you can try the [Docker container cloud hosting](https://www.stackhero.io/en/services/Docker/benefits) for free for a month.

Stackhero is probably the easiest way to deploy containers to production. To learn more, visit [Stackhero for Docker](https://www.stackhero.io/en/services/Docker/benefits).
